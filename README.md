# FireTechCamp Resource Development Project.

Hi Guys and Girls! 
This project has been created for FireTechCamp Alumni. 
It contains all sorts of Unity Game Engine resources and learning material. 
Hopefully, it will be the perfect place for you to continue your learning!

## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure you have Unity 2017.1 on your computer! Then, download the project using the green 'clone or download' button. 
```
Unity releases new versions all the time. All the code in this project (at time of writing) will scale with their API Checker. 
So, if you have Unity 2017.2, or Unity 2017.3, you can follow the same instructions!
It will just do a little conversion when it opens. Remember to click yes on the dialog!
```
Once it has loaded, open Unity. 
In Unity, browse to the containing folder, and click 'Select Folder'. Voila, project open!

### Instructions

The project is broken up into 'scenes' that you can investigate. Each scene has its own folder in 'Assets/Scenes/' that contains its materials, textures and scripts!

A good place to start here is to open the 'Welcome Scene'.
To do this, go to your base Assets folder in the Project Tab.
From here, navigate to the Scenes folder. In here are all the projects different scenes!
One of them is called WelcomeScene. Double click to open it.
Once it is open, press play to receive a welcome message!

Once you are done playing the scene, you may either look at other scenes, or at the code for WelcomeScene. 
All the code for WelcomeScene is contained on the SceneController in the Hierarchy. 
If you click on the SceneController, then double click on "Welcome Screen Controller" script link, it will open the file in your default text editor.
You could also find this script at 'Assets/Scenes/WelcomeScene/Scripts/'


## Conclusion

This project will be continuously added to. To get the new content, you will have to redownload the project! 
You will notice, that as the project is added to, the 'commit' number in the top left will climb. 
At the time of this writing, commit level is at:

```
4 Commits
```

I want to wish you all the very best of luck, and hope you continue learning, no matter what.
